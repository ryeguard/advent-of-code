# Advent of Code 2024

This year I am refreshing my Go coding skills. My day-to-day language is currently Python and Typescript, so it's time for a refresher. It will also be refreshing to write code without support from Co-pilots. I have gotten used to using tab-completion and chats extensively to write code. While it makes me more productive, it has also made me a worse programmer (I think).
